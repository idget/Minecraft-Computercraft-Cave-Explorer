# Minecraft-Computercraft-Cave-Explorer
Computercraft mod enabled automated cave explorer turtle for Minecraft. Runs through a cave and lights it up with torches.

## Dungeon Explorer

### Usage
1.) Start turtle on the far right of a dungeon corridor.
2.) The turtle will move fowards unless the right block is empty, which causes it to turn right. Running into a block causes the turtle to turn left.
3.) The turtle places a torch every 10 blocks

Repeat the same thing with a turtle starting on the left and using a mirrored algorithm to quickly explore an entire cave section.

The turtles need to be filled with torches and a single empty slot for comparing to empty blocks.
